When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to be able to openly collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might want to decide when to get certain files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you copy a git repository within GitHub only. A clone is when you copy a repository within your local git or from github to a local git. Branches are commits that are within a certain git log hitory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that you can easily access without internet the last known state and work on it.

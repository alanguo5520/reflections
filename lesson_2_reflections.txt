When you initialize a repository using git init, it creates a .git file and has no commits. You need to do it to collaborate using git in that file.

The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository. It's different from the working directory in that it is a copy that can be committed, but its not in the repository because it hasn't been committed yet. Having a staging area allows you to control exactly what you want to commit at a single time.
